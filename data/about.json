        "short": "I was raised in San Diego, formally educated at UCLA, and now work and live in Los Angeles as a web developer. My interest in web development intersects with interaction design, data visualization, and augmented reality. When I'm not making stuff for the web, I like to dabble in illustration, photography, and game development just to name a few. Lately, I've been engrossed by the intersection between food, culture, and media."
