## Step 1

Start a new project by clicking `File->New->New Project` or using the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N` (on Windows).

## Step 2

Import the video file you want to rotate by clicking `File->Import->File` or using the shortcut `Ctrl+I` (on Windows). Find your video file and select to import it. This will open your video file on the "composition platform". 

## Step 3

Select and drag your video from the composition platform to the timeline area.

## Step 5

To the right of the rotation name are two number parameters. The first parameter is the number of seconds after the beginning of the video where the rotation begins. Leave it at "0" if you want the entire duration of the video to be rotated. The second parameter lets you set the number for the degree of rotation (0 - 360).
