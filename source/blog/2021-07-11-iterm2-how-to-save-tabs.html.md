1. Make sure iTerm2 is opened, focused, and ready to roll
2. Select iTerm2 "Window" > "Save Arrangement Window" (or use the shortcut Shift+Command+S)
3. A modal will pop up asking you to name your saved tab arrangement. Pick a memorable name like "Tab Arrangement #13"
4. Boom, you've saved your iTerm2 tab arrangement. To restore your memorably named tab arrangement, just select "Window" > "Restore Window Arrangement" and then select "Tab Arrangement #13"
