    <h3 class="row__title">Hey I'm Ozy</h3>
    <p class="row__p">My full name is Oscar Wu-Li or (<span class="ch"><a href="/web/20160307121538/http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=%E5%90%B4%E5%8D%8E%E5%9C%A3" target="_blank">吴华圣</a></span>). But I go by my nickname Ozy.</p>
    <p class="row__p">
        I was raised in San Diego, formally educated at UCLA, and now work and live in Los Angeles. I first learned how to program and design for the web by just using it and being curious. Before you know it, a hobby turns into a career. When I'm not making stuff for the web, I like to dabble in illustration, 3d modelling, and photography. Just to name a few. Lately, I've been engrossed by the intersection between food, culture, and media.

    <p class="row__p">I'm currently employed full-time at <a href="https://pxlagency.com" target="_blank">PXL Agency</a> but am open to collaboration on interesting projects.</p>
